Commonalities Across All 18 Stalled/Expired/Abandoned Network Protocol Proposals
=================================================================================

1. Transport Layer Positioning
------------------------------
All 18 protocols operate at Layer 4 (transport) or the L3/L4 boundary. None are
purely application-layer, link-layer, or physical-layer. Every one sits in the
same architectural slot as TCP/UDP and competes for the same niche.

2. Every One Identifies a Specific TCP/IP Deficiency
-----------------------------------------------------
Not a single protocol was invented in a vacuum. Each one begins from an explicit,
documented problem with TCP, UDP, or IP:
- TCP's byte-stream lacks message boundaries (CurveCP, SST, DCCP, SCTP, XTP, IL, Minion)
- TCP has no encryption (CurveCP, MinimaLT, tcpcrypt)
- TCP's handshake wastes resources (CurveCP, MinimaLT, SCTP)
- TCP has head-of-line blocking (SST, SCTP)
- IP addresses conflate identity with location (HIP)
- TCP is all-or-nothing reliable (DCCP, PR-SCTP, XTP, UDP-Lite, SST)
- No per-flow QoS in IP (RSVP, DiffServ interworking, XTP)

Every protocol's stated motivation is a reaction to something TCP/IP does wrong.

3. Message/Datagram Orientation
-------------------------------
The single most repeated feature across all 18. At least 10 protocols explicitly
tried to add message boundaries that TCP lacks:
- CurveCP, SST, DCCP, SCTP, XTP, IL, Minion (explicitly message-oriented)
- MinimaLT (stream multiplexing implies framing)
- UDP-Lite (datagram-native)
- MASQUE (tunnels datagrams)

This is the most universally desired missing feature from TCP.

4. All Had Formal Public Specifications
---------------------------------------
Every single one produced a publicly available specification:
- IETF Internet-Drafts: MinimaLT, tcpcrypt, Minion, TAPS, MASQUE, Multipath DCCP,
  DiffServ interworking, PR-SCTP
- Published RFCs (Experimental or Standard): DCCP (4340), SCTP (9260), HIP (7401/9063),
  RSVP (2205), UDP-Lite (3828), tcpcrypt (8548), MASQUE (9297/9298)
- Academic papers/standalone specs: CurveCP (DJB), SST (MIT SIGCOMM 2007), XTP, IL
  (Plan 9), NEAT (EU)

None were proprietary. All were open. Openness alone was insufficient.

5. All Have Branded Acronyms or Short Names
-------------------------------------------
Every protocol named itself with a catchy, memorable identifier: CurveCP, MinimaLT,
SST, tcpcrypt, DCCP, SCTP, HIP, RSVP, XTP, Minion, NEAT, TAPS, MASQUE, IL, PR-SCTP,
UDP-Lite, IntServ, DiffServ. Marketing-style naming was universal and universally
insufficient.

6. Zero Achieved Widespread Deployment
--------------------------------------
This is the most absolute commonality. Not one reached critical mass:
- Even those with ratified RFCs (SCTP, DCCP, UDP-Lite, HIP) saw minimal real-world use
- Even those with kernel implementations (SCTP in Linux, DCCP in Linux, tcpcrypt patches)
  stayed niche
- Even those with partial deployment (SCTP in telephony signaling, MASQUE partial
  standardization) never generalized

7. No Adoption Champion
-----------------------
Not one had a major industry player (Google, Apple, Microsoft, a browser vendor)
pushing deployment:
- CurveCP: DJB solo effort
- MinimaLT: Academic paper, no backer
- SST: MIT thesis project
- tcpcrypt: Small academic group
- XTP: Military/research niche
- IL: Bell Labs/Plan 9 internal
- NEAT: EU-funded research project
- TAPS: IETF working group with no implementer pressure
- DCCP, SCTP, HIP: IETF RFCs with no product driving adoption

Contrast with QUIC: Google shipped it in Chrome + their servers, creating instant
deployment to billions of users. None of these 18 had that.

8. Middlebox/NAT/Firewall Incompatibility
------------------------------------------
The majority were killed or severely hampered by network middleboxes that only pass
TCP (port 80/443) and UDP:
- New IP protocol numbers blocked: DCCP, SCTP, HIP (all use IP protocol numbers that
  firewalls drop)
- UDP-based but blocked: CurveCP, MinimaLT, SST
- Modified TCP semantics mangled: Minion, tcpcrypt
- Required middlebox upgrades: HIP, RSVP (every router in path)
- Had to add UDP encapsulation as workaround: SCTP (RFC 6951), adding overhead and
  complexity

Only Minion and tcpcrypt were explicitly designed for middlebox survival, and even
they failed.

9. Required Both Endpoints to Upgrade Simultaneously
-----------------------------------------------------
Every protocol needed coordinated deployment -- both client and server must support
it, or it falls back to nothing useful:
- tcpcrypt: "Deployment required both endpoints to upgrade simultaneously"
- HIP: "Requires changes at end-hosts AND potentially middleboxes"
- RSVP: "Requires universal deployment to work"
- This chicken-and-egg problem is universal to all 18

No protocol solved the incremental/unilateral deployment problem.

10. QUIC or TLS 1.3 Eventually Absorbed Their Key Innovation
-------------------------------------------------------------
At least 12 of the 18 had their primary contribution subsumed by QUIC or TLS 1.3:

  Feature                      Original Protocol(s)               Absorbed By
  ---------------------------  -----------------------------------  -----------
  Always-on encryption         CurveCP, MinimaLT, tcpcrypt         QUIC
  0-RTT resumption             MinimaLT                            QUIC, TLS 1.3
  Stream multiplexing          SST, Minion, SCTP, MinimaLT         QUIC, HTTP/2
  No head-of-line blocking     SST, SCTP                           QUIC
  Connection migration         CurveCP, MinimaLT, HIP              QUIC
  Pluggable congestion ctrl    DCCP                                 QUIC
  DoS-resistant handshake      CurveCP, MinimaLT, SCTP             QUIC retry
  Message framing              Minion                               HTTP/2

The pioneers did the R&D; QUIC shipped the product.

11. All Use Connection/Session Concepts
---------------------------------------
Even protocols designed for datagrams added session semantics:
- DCCP: "connection-oriented" explicitly
- CurveCP: cookie-based sessions
- MinimaLT: sessions with resumption
- SCTP: "associations" (their term for connections)
- HIP: "base exchange" establishing identity binding
- XTP: fast connection setup
- IL: reliable sessions

Pure connectionless transport (raw UDP) was not what any of them wanted. Every one
added state.

12. Handshake Innovation
------------------------
Nearly every protocol redesigned the handshake, and all tried to improve on TCP's
3-way:
- CurveCP: cookie-based, no server state until client proves receipt
- MinimaLT: 0-RTT with key caching
- SCTP: 4-way with cookie (INIT/INIT-ACK/COOKIE-ECHO/COOKIE-ACK)
- HIP: 4-way "base exchange" with crypto
- tcpcrypt: 1 extra RTT for key exchange
- DCCP: feature negotiation at setup
- XTP: "fast connection setup"

All converged on the same insight: TCP's SYN allocates server resources too early.
But each invented a different solution independently.

13. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (Among Crypto Protocols)
--------------------------------------------------------
Every protocol that included cryptography used a Diffie-Hellman variant:
- CurveCP: Curve25519 (ECDH)
- MinimaLT: Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
- tcpcrypt: Key exchange (DH-based)
- HIP: Public key-based exchange

None used RSA key transport, pre-shared keys as primary, or anything exotic. DH was
the universal choice.

14. Forward Secrecy via Ephemeral Keys
--------------------------------------
Every crypto-enabled protocol generated fresh keys per session:
- CurveCP: "Ephemeral keys per session"
- MinimaLT: "Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman per connection"
- tcpcrypt: Session-scoped keys
- HIP: Per-association keys

No protocol used long-term static keys for data encryption. All understood PFS was
mandatory.

15. Flexible Reliability as a Feature
--------------------------------------
Multiple protocols independently concluded that TCP's "fully reliable or nothing"
model is wrong:
- SST: "Reliable + unreliable modes per-stream"
- DCCP: "Unreliable delivery with congestion control"
- PR-SCTP: "Timed reliability / retransmission-limited"
- XTP: "Selective reliability per-message"
- UDP-Lite: "Accept partially corrupt data"
- SCTP: "Ordered and unordered delivery per-stream"

Six protocols independently reinvented configurable reliability. This is the second
most repeated feature after message orientation.

16. Congestion Control Innovation
---------------------------------
Multiple protocols tried to go beyond TCP's AIMD:
- DCCP: Pluggable CCIDs (TCP-like CCID2 or TFRC CCID3)
- XTP: Rate-based flow control (not window-based)
- SST: Shared congestion control across child streams
- SCTP: Per-association congestion control

All recognized TCP's congestion control was insufficient but each proposed different
solutions.

17. Mobility/Multi-homing
--------------------------
Multiple protocols independently tried to decouple sessions from IP addresses:
- CurveCP: "Connection survives IP address changes"
- MinimaLT: "Sessions persist across IP address changes"
- HIP: "Seamless handoff when IP address changes" + multi-homing
- SCTP: Multi-homing with multiple IPs per endpoint

Four protocols independently solving the same problem of mobile/multi-homed hosts.

18. DoS/Flood Resistance
-------------------------
Three protocols independently invented proof-of-work or cookie-based DoS resistance:
- CurveCP: "Cookie-based DoS protection"
- MinimaLT: "Puzzle-based client proof-of-work"
- SCTP: "Four-way handshake with cookie"

All three arrived at the same insight: make the client prove it's real before the
server spends resources.

19. No Operational/Management Features
--------------------------------------
Not a single one included:
- Configuration management
- Change journaling or audit trails
- Built-in telemetry beyond basic RTT
- Automatic rollback
- Configuration versioning

All 18 focused exclusively on data transport. None crossed into the operational
management plane. This is the gap POOL's spec identifies.

20. All Span the Same Era (~1990-2018)
--------------------------------------
- 1990s: XTP, IL, RSVP/IntServ
- 2000s: SCTP, DCCP, HIP, SST, DiffServ interworking
- 2010s: CurveCP, MinimaLT, tcpcrypt, Minion, NEAT, TAPS, MASQUE, Multipath DCCP

All predate or are contemporary with QUIC's standardization (RFC 9000, 2021). None
emerged after QUIC proved that deployment via a major browser was the only viable path.

21. All Failed to Solve Their Own Deployment Problem
----------------------------------------------------
Every protocol solved a technical problem but not the deployment problem. None included:
- A migration strategy from TCP/IP
- A "shim" or compatibility layer that worked transparently
- A killer application that forced adoption
- An incentive structure for network operators

tcpcrypt came closest ("no application changes needed") but still needed OS kernel
changes on both sides.

22. Complexity vs. Adoption Inverse Relationship
-------------------------------------------------
The more comprehensive the protocol, the faster it died:
- XTP: "Over-engineered for its era"
- HIP: "Complexity of deployment for marginal perceived benefit"
- RSVP: "Operational complexity: requires universal deployment"
- DiffServ interworking: "Mapping complexity was never cleanly resolved"
- NEAT: "Complexity of supporting many transports simultaneously"

Meanwhile the simplest ones (UDP-Lite, IL) failed for the opposite reason -- too
niche. There was no sweet spot.

23. Built on Already-Stalled Foundations
----------------------------------------
Three protocols compounded failure by depending on other failed protocols:
- Multipath DCCP -> built on DCCP (barely deployed)
- PR-SCTP -> built on SCTP (barely deployed)
- DiffServ interworking -> built on RSVP/IntServ (abandoned)

Stacking on a failed protocol guaranteed failure.

24. All Proposed New APIs or Socket Semantics
---------------------------------------------
Every protocol required applications to use something other than the BSD socket API:
- SST: "Required applications to be rewritten for new API"
- TAPS/NEAT: Explicitly designed new abstract APIs
- SCTP: New socket types (SOCK_SEQPACKET)
- DCCP: New socket type (SOCK_DCCP)
- Even tcpcrypt, which claimed transparency, needed new kernel syscalls for session IDs

The BSD socket API from 1983 outlived every challenger.

25. All Solved Problems That Still Exist Today
----------------------------------------------
Every problem these protocols identified remains unsolved in mainstream deployment:
- TCP still has no built-in encryption (relies on TLS above it)
- IP addresses still conflate identity and location
- TCP is still all-or-nothing reliable
- There's still no per-flow QoS reservation on the public internet
- There's still no reliable multicast transport standard
- TCP still has head-of-line blocking (outside of QUIC)

The problems were real. The solutions were real. The deployment path was not.

26. None Had a Reference Implementation That Shipped in a Product
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- CurveCP: Reference code existed, no product used it
- SCTP: Linux kernel implementation, used only by telephony (SS7/SIGTRAN) and WebRTC
  internals
- DCCP: Linux kernel implementation, effectively unused
- tcpcrypt: Linux kernel patches, never mainlined
- All others: academic prototypes or nothing

Summary
-------
If you distill every commonality down to its core: all 18 are technically sound
solutions to real problems, specified publicly, that died because the internet's
deployed infrastructure (middleboxes + OS kernels + the BSD socket API + application
inertia) is a stronger force than any specification. They all share the same DNA:
DH-based crypto, message orientation, session state, handshake innovation, flexible
reliability, and death by ecosystem ossification.
